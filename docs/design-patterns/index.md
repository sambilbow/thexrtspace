# What is a Design Pattern?
In Chapter 4 of my thesis, I outlined the primary vehicle through which to address the key topics and questions of the thesis: the creation and evaluation of sound ARt experiences. These have, in their development and iteration, drawn on a proto-framework of implicit designerly tendencies and patterns that I have found effective - drawing from points of resistance, and relevant perspectives from the field (Chapter 3). In this section the aim is to outline these patterns in a way that may allow for the creation of similar works of ARt in the future, by members of the experimental music, computational art, and digital humanities fields. The term design pattern here, is borrowed from the field of computer science, where it is taken to describe a set of “communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general design problem in a particular context” {% cite gamma1995 %}.

A design pattern thus “names, abstracts, and identifies the key aspects of a common design structure that make it useful for creating a reusable object-oriented design”. So, while as a method it may not operate completely as it would in its native computer science, to address the outstanding aim of the thesis – namely to contribute to the field of experimental music a guide to sound ARt composition – design patterns do serve to be less rigid than frameworks, more problem-focused than guidelines; whilst inheriting the meaningful organisational structure that comes with an object-oriented design approach. Design patterns are characterised by having four elements:

- The pattern name describes the design problem at a higher level of abstraction
- The problem describes the specific situation in which you might apply the pattern
- The solution describes the relationships between elements of the pattern that aim to solve the problem
- The consequences are the results and trade-offs of applying the pattern

These design patterns are therefore subject to iteration, and this site hosts their latest version. The principles used to guide the patterns draw on the resistances outlined in Chapter 4 of my thesis, namely taking a DIY approach, decoupling from the ocularcentric and layering paradigms of typical AR experience, and attempting to navigate an inherently consumerist space whilst trying not to contribute to exploitative systems of oppression that uphold it. They are also guided by the theoretical proposals of enactivism in Chapter 3: that participant’s and performer’s cognitive processes in the experience of AR artworks are embodied, embedded, enacted, and extended, and have the potential to be modulated to extents that offer novel aesthetic experiences of augmented materiality, embodiment, and space. The following sections outline three design patterns: 

- [Designing for Rich AR Experience](rich-ar.html)
- [Consideration of the AR Instrument](ar-instrument.html)
- [Role of the Virtual in the AR Environment](virtual-role.html)
