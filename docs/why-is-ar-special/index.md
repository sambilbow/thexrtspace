# Why is AR special?

## Introduction
This set of pages takes a retrospective view at the history of augmented reality technologies. In laying clear the origination of these technologies within predominantly visual fields of research, it allows for a critique of preconceived notions about the definitions of what AR is, and the boundaries of how it is used today. The review outlines the contemporary forms, sensory display techniques, and methods taken to mediate our reality with virtual processes. In sketching out this wide variety of possible arising interactions, I make clear the benefit of considering AR as a medium for expressive computational artwork, namely in its inherent ability to approach technology from a creative and inclusive perspective (not just from the perspective of viewing AR as a visual overlay tool). I then touch on examples of AR art that make much more creative use of the materiality of AR in this way.
