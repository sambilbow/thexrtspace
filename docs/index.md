## Home
This website is an inclusive space for artists, developers, and creative practitioners working with XR (AR/VR) technologies to share tools & methods, and showcase their XRt!

## What is XRt? Do we really need another acronym?!
XRt is any art that uses XR technology as its medium of expression. This includes AR/VR technologies that engage any sensory system, with the chief aim of mediating perception (AR) or synthesizing perception (VR). 

Part of this website's reason for existence is to broaden our view of XR as a whole, and consider how it can be used to create rich and expressive sensory experiences beyond the typical visual layering paradigm.
