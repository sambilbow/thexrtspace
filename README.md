This repository holds the Jekyll source files for The XRt Space website - an inclusive space for artists, developers, and creative practitioners working with XR (AR/VR) technologies to share tools & methods, and showcase their XRt!

## What is XRt? Do we really need another acronym?!
XRt is any art that uses XR technology as its medium of expression. This includes AR/VR technologies that engage any sensory system, with the chief aim of mediating perception (AR) or synthesizing perception (VR) in a manner that emphasises aesthetic experience.

Part of this website's reason for existence is to broaden our view of XR as a whole, and consider how it can be used to create rich and expressive sensory experiences beyond the typical visual layering paradigm.

## Discord Community
If you are interested in sharing tools & methods for creating XRt or you just want to showcase your work, check out The XRt Space Discord server.

### A sidenote on VR Contributions
I don't work with VR at all, so at current the site is biased towards AR knowledge and practice. The XRt space is definitely looking for contributors that would be able to fill the VR section of the site with a similar depth content to that found in the AR section!
